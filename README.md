# Apartment App Challenge

As a developer, I have been commissioned to create an application for managing and viewing apartment rentals.  
The application has two kinds of users: unregistered users who can look at apartment listings and registered users who can create listings for apartments available for rent.  
Apartment listings have a street designation, city, state, a manager's name, manager's contact email, monthly rental price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and whether they allow pets.
If my work is acceptable to my client, I may also be asked to add the ability for a registered user to remove an apartment from the list as well as edit the apartment information.



## User Stories
